# jChat-Server
A CLI client for my jChat project. Still in early development. The code is probably trash.

Events are printed with color escape codes.
The username implementation is still kinda early but it should work correctly

## Building
To build the server by yourself you'll need to clone the repository and open a terminal at its location.

Now, run `javac MultiServer.java` to build the .class file. If you desire you can run it by typing `java MultiServer`.

If you want to build a JAR file, run `jar cvfm jChat-Server.jar manifest.txt *.class`.
